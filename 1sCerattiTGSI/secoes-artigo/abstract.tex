Governance of information technology (IT) is becoming important in the organizations, 
because it facilitates decision-making through the alignment of IT with the area 
(of business) the focus of the organization. However, the IT governance is a slow 
and expensive process in terms of infrastructure and resources. This paper presents a 
study about IT governance in an advanced campus of the Federal University of Santa Maria 
(UFSM-FW) and propose a reorganization of the IT services with support to the open source 
tools. The study demonstrated the necessity of a restructuring of the IT sector and that 
the support of the tools for automation can turn the UFSM more manageable. 
KEY-WORDS: IT Governance, framework, tool.
